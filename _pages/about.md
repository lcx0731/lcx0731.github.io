My name is Lyu Chenxin. I am a second-year MPhil student from the [Department of Mathematics](https://hkumath.hku.hk/web/index.php), at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). My research interests include financial mathematics, insurance, machine learning, and stochastic analysis.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr. WONG Tak Kwong](https://hkumath.hku.hk/~takkwong/) and [Dr. ZHANG Zhiwen](https://www.scifac.hku.hk/people/zhang-zhiwen) during my MPhil study. Also, I appreciate the guidance of [Prof. Phillip YAM](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/scpy/) from the [Department of Statistics](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/), [ the Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html).
